                <p> I am Aphiwe MKhize from KwaZulu-Natal best known as KZN.I am a sister to 4 siblings who is gonna be
                    the first Data Engineer in her home town.Its a blast being here at Wits but i have to keep in mind
                    that the Wits Edge has to be beaten at all costs.Being here at Wits and doing a degree that is
                    mostly male dominated is a privillage</p>

                <h3> Latest Project</h3>
                <p> I have built a website called <strong>Ayanda's Mini Online Data Center</strong>.This project is
                    designed to help small businesses organise,store,structure and be able to retrieve their data without
                    any redundancies.This project was inspired by my knowledge in Information Systems.These websites are essential for modern
                     digital operations,acting as the foundation for the internet, cloud computing, and various business applications.</p>
                    
                    <p>Initially i came to the university of the witwatersrand  to become a doctor but i am afraid of blood thus i resorted to studying Computer which i also figured out that
                     i can also work in healthcare facilities by processing their data simply by being a data analyst or data engineer  at a health care facility 
                     so hope is not lost afterall.Being a data engineer in the healthcare sector involves designing, building, and maintaining robust ETL pipelines to 
                     integrate, clean, and managecomplex, disparate data from Electronic Health Records (EHR), devices, and API sources </p>
